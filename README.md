# Interview Take-Home Projects

This repository contains take-home projects completed as part of real interview processes.  
The projects are intentionally scoped to demonstrate engineering judgment, system design, and production-oriented thinking under time constraints.

Most of my production work has been in private or proprietary repositories. The projects here are representative examples intended to illustrate my approach to building and delivering software systems.

## Projects

### Lightbox – User Posts API
A REST API for managing users and their posts, implemented using Python and Django Rest Framework.

- Demonstrates API design, persistence, validation, testing, and Docker-based local execution
- Includes design notes and potential production improvements

## Notes

Each project includes a README describing:
- Context and constraints
- Design decisions and trade-offs
- How to run and test the service
- Potential improvements for a production deployment
